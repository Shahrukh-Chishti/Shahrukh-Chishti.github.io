## Alfa Beats
Portable virtual drumkit that relay beats to mobile receipient.
This is arduino DIY was concieved in the end of 2018.
The RF based prototype is complete.
Presently, I am optimising its circuitry space to ease the mass production.
And I plan to roll-out the $1^{st}$ gen product by end of Jan20.

This project is inspired by a philosophy of a tribal village [FOLI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVPLIuBy9CY&t=279s).
Its about mass productive synchronisation, maintaining flow indefinitely.

In the end, it should become something like this, [PocketDrum](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pocketdrum-the-most-portable-drum-set-ever#/), though much cheaper.
