$Mathematics$ is utlimate objectification of knowledge.
It begins with axioms objectified from philosophy. 

Here, we discuss some findings related to non-linear dynamics & modular algebra.
These topics are **analysed** in various directions to demonstrate various properties.
**Proofs** are also provided. **Applications** of these finding is suggested.
And **connection** of these findings to established mathematics is provided to formalise and extend the research.

It may also be possible to derive these results from higher level theorems.
But then this ladder has no end and I have bound on my knowledge capacity.
Feel free to correct & extend these analyses.
