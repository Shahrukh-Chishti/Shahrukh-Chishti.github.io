This work demonstrates fractals generated by place-value representation of various number series.
The appearance count of a symbol in a numeral representation show how two recursive process, series generation and numeral encoding, builds self-similar structures.
The appearance count of digit $0$ is called sparsity.
Finally, some very related works are mildly explained. The subject of study in these works bear the common theme around fractals, counting & number series.
Mainly, this article is reporting an observation on naturally occurring numbers because of formal representation and goes on just describing the formulation to understand this ideal phenomenon.
Following article discusses the sparsity on the various representation $\Enc$ of various number series $n_i$.
Radix $r$ defines various representation in a place-value convention.
## Abstract
Place-value notation used in most of modern numeral representation is a recursive method. Representation of an integer series in a positional notation inherits this recursive nature.

This study exposes fractal patterns emerging in the sparsity of place value notation of integer series.

# Fractal Nature
* Countable infinity
this is going in reverse order
* Geometry of seed structure
* Fractal dimension
it would be interesting to calculate the fractal dimension.
but how and who ?
* 2-D ness
	* Series + Place-value notation. Confluence of two-recursive process.
	* Renders Sparsity of Geometric series flat.
* Functions and Fractals
	* Function of the sparsity. Count($\Enc$)
	* Appearance of probabilistic multi-fractals in language models
