## Abstract
Place-value notation used in most of modern numeral representation is a recursive method. Representation of an integer series in a positional notation inherits this recursive nature.

This study exposes fractal patterns emerging in the sparsity of place value notation of integer series.

# Introduction
Fractals are self-similar structures that appear in diverse natural contexts. From biology to ion-propulsion technology to non-linear dynamics they have been diversely used to represent, explain \& optimise various phenomenons.

Fundamentally, fractals consist of a seed pattern and a recursive rule that grows a fractal structure out of seed pattern. 
It can be compared to a dynamical system with recursive evolution of state given a starting point and parameters of evolution.
By and large, they are scale invariant.
Recursive growth keep their algorithmic complexity ridiculously low.

Generation of number series can be represented as recursive process with seed parameters $\theta$, that defines initial position and parameters of the recursive rule $f$.
These numbers that denote a value are traditionally represented in place-value notation, which is a recursive encoding algorithm in itself. 

This work demonstrates fractals generated by place-value representation of various number series.
The appearance count of a symbol in a numeral representation show how two recursive process, series generation and numeral encoding, builds self-similar structures.
The appearance count of digit $0$ is called sparsity.

Running multiple experiments across various encoding \& series attempts to explain variation in fractal geometry generated as a result of change in seeds \& recursive rule. For this study we restrict the scope to whole numbers $\mathbb{W}$ representation.

## Numeral Systems
Numbers are mathematical object that are used for counting, measuring and representation. In writing a number under a script requires rules of representation, known as numeral system.
Representing a numerical value in symbolic notation is next only to counting in the development of mathematics. And it is necessary for communication to assign language \& script to a value.

Physical representation of number directly affects computation \& calculations and simulations and so on. Based on diverse cultural expression and computational utility many number systems have evolved:
* Positional Number system
	* Fixed radix, Mixed radix, Factorial radix
	* Babylonian
* Roman numerals
* Asymmetric number system

## Place Value Notation
Almost all of modern world uses place-value notation to write down numbers $x$, which is composed of symbols $S$, called digits $d$. Each digit is symbolic for smaller value, which are elements of representation. The cardinality of symbol set $S$ is called radix or base $r$.

Many physical manifestation of these numbers require closure of space. It is a bound because of physical limits of computation that is needed to represent the complete space. A good way to express this representation is through finite vector space $S^{N}$, where $N$ is the representation capacity.

$$ x \in \whole \qquad \Enc(x) \rightarrow S^{N} \qquad \Rightarrow d_{N-1} \cdots d_0 \qquad d_i \in S $$

An insignificant symbol which is usually zero $0$, that doesn't hold any value, is appended to the remaining left \& right.
### Recursive Encoding
Beginning with radix $r$ and capacity $N$ positional-notation encoding can be carried as follows:
$$
\begin{gather}
    d_i = \x{i} \mod{r} \qquad \x{i} = \lfloor{\frac{\x{i-1}}{r}}\rfloor = \R(\x{i-1}) \\
    x = \x{0} \qquad \Rightarrow d_i = \floor*{ \frac{ \cdots \floor*{\frac{x}{r}}  \cdots} {r}  }^{i} \mod{r} \Rightarrow d_i = \R^{i}(x) \mod{r}
\end{gather}
$$

while computationally equivalent decoding process $\Dec$ is better understood and expressed as iterative sum

$$
    \Dec : S^N \rightarrow \whole \qquad x = \sum_{i}^{N} r^i d_i
$$

Thus, the algebraic equation for auto-encoding,
$$ 
    \sum_i^N \big( \R^i (x) \mod{r} \big) r^i = x
$$ is invariant over radix $r$, given $N$ is sufficient capacity $N \geq \log_r x$.

In this way, the summation aggregation $\sum$ is counter-acting recursive flooring $\R$.

We define a recursion operator $\Omega : \Operator \cross \whole \rightarrow \whole^N $. This returns the trajectory of a dynamical system $ O \in \Operator $ starting at $x \in \whole $ as a vector. 

$$
\begin{gather}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    x & \R(x) & \R(\R(x)) & \cdots
    \end{bmatrix} \mod{r} \odot
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & r & r^2 & \cdots
    \end{bmatrix} = x \\
    \Rightarrow \begin{bmatrix} x & R(x) & R^2(x) & \cdots \end{bmatrix} \mod{r} \odot \begin{bmatrix} 1 & r & r^2 & \cdots \end{bmatrix} = x \\
    \Rightarrow \{ 0,1,\cdots (r-1) \}^N \cross \whole^N \rightarrow \whole \\
    R(x) = \floor*{\frac{x}{r}} \ \in \Operator , \qquad P(x) = xr \ \in \Operator \\
    R \rightarrow \Omega_N(R,x) \mod r = \begin{bmatrix} x & R(x) & R^2(x) & \cdots \end{bmatrix} \mod{r} \\
    P \rightarrow \Omega_N(P,r) \divisionsymbol r = \begin{bmatrix} r & r^2 & r^3 & \cdots \end{bmatrix} \divisionsymbol r \\
    \Rightarrow \ \Omega_N(R,x) \mod r \odot \Omega_N(P,r) \divisionsymbol r = x
\end{gather} 
$$

is invariant $x$ over radix(base) $r$ change.

### Series generation
Algorithm generated number series of length $l$ as mentioned before requires a seed values $\theta$ and a recursive rule $f \in \Operator $

$$
\begin{gather*}
    x_{n+1} = f ( x_i \cdots x_{n-1} , x_n ) \\
    \Rightarrow x_0 \cdots x_n \cdots x_{l-1} 
\end{gather*}
$$

This might not be universal definition but within the scope of this study it is suffices necessary variations.
Three fundamental series are considered :
* Arithmetic Progression : $ A := f ( x_n ) \rightarrow x_n + a$. $x_{n+1} = x_0 + na \ \Rightarrow A^n(x_0)$ 
    
    $0,1,2,3,4 \cdots $. $\seed=\{x_0:0,a=1\}$ .
* Geometric Progression : $ B := f ( x_n ) \rightarrow x_n * g$. $x_{n+1} = x_0 g^n \ \Rightarrow B^n(x_0)$
    
    $1,2,4,8 \cdots $. $\seed=\{x_0:1,g=2\}$ .
* Fibonacci progression : $ F:= f ( x_n , x_{n-1} ) \rightarrow x_n + x_{n-1} $. $ ?? $ nothing here, doesnt belong to the class of $F^n(x_0)$
    
    $1,1,2,3,5 \cdotsts $ . $\seed=\{x_0:1,x_1=1\}$ . 

Fibonacci series cannot be analytically represented because of its non-linear progression rule.  It should be noted that geometric is multiplicative in progression, but under logarithm transform it is equivalent to linear series.

### Invariance
Invariance over base radix $r$ is true over all $\whole^l == \whole^l$ recursively generated number series $x_n$

$$
    \Invariance \ : \ \Omega_N(R,x_n) \mod r \odot \Omega_N(P,r) \divisionsymbol r = x_n \ \forall \ x_n = f^n(x_0) 
$$


### Article Structure

Following article discusses a measure, the sparsity on the various representation $\Enc$ of various number series $n_i$.
Radix $r$ defines various representation in a place-value convention.
The observations are based on running simulations to identify the properties of the sparsity in a numeral system.
Further, mathematical statements are presented to understand the behaviour algebraically. The nature of recursion is probed through fractal patterns appearing in the sparsity of fundamental representation of number systems.
Finally, some very related works are mildly explained. The subject of study in these works bear the common theme around fractals, counting \& number series.

Mainly, this article is reporting an observation on naturally occurring numbers because of formal representation and goes on just describing the formulation to understand this ideal phenomenon.


# Sparsity Fractals

Sparsity is the count of zeros in a vector and it can be generalised as appearance of digit $d$.
It is a measure of emptiness in a tuple of numbers, where choice of zero $0$ is treated as object of study. It is symbolic of least important symbol in the calculations of tuples, which usually is associated with a context, be it mathematical e.g.\ addition, subtraction etc.

We consider sparse vectors as inefficient method of storing numbers and making memories. Higher sparsity means poor representation. This appeal of sufficiency expresses innate human inclination towards parsimony.

We reject non-ideal world, where states have appearance probabilities and do not ascribe differentiation among states. This defines capacity $N$ less in terms of information and more in representation quality.

To express $l$ values, be it unique index of $l$ states through numbers $0,1 \cdots l-1 $ in a place-value notation, we choose basis $r$ and capacity $N$. 
For $N = \floor*{\log_r l} $, the place-value notation just sufficiently represents all the numbers from $0$ to $l-1$.

In general, appearance of $0$ in this representation is attributed to following condition

$$
\begin{gather*}
    \floor*{\frac{R^i(x)}{r}} \mod{r} = 0 \ \Rightarrow \ \text{if} \floor*{\frac{R^i(x)}{r}} = zr \ \text{, for some integer }z \\
    \Rightarrow R^i(x) \in \left[ zr^2, (zr+1)r \right)
\end{gather*}
$$

 The uncertainty in $\frac{x_0}{r^{n}} \sim  R^n(x_0)$ and inaccuracy in the diagram increases with every step $i$.

## Sparsity function

$$
\begin{gather*}
    \sparsity = N - \sum_i^N d_i \qquad \Rightarrow N - \sum_i^N \big( \R^i (x) \mod{2} \big) \\
    N - \sum \big( \Omega_N(R,x) \mod{r} \big) \qquad \sum : \{ 0,1 \}^N \rightarrow \{ 0,1, \cdots N \}
\end{gather*}
