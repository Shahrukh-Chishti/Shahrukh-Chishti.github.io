## Objective of Blog
This blog space is meant to present various works in process, completion or ideation.
It is meant to be growing with suggestion and research. That blog-post are not static; would be revised.
Some are completed research, some exposition of new idea and others opinion etc.
In future, I would try to classify these works for the sake of clarity.

I would try to maintain originality of work supported by appropriate references.
All the articles is preserved through blog framework.
Repository of supporting data, code etc. is attached to corresponding blog.
So you can try, help, correct and extend research.

In a nutshell, this space is dedicated to publish my independent efforts towards scientific progress to be visible to a larger community
## Structuring of Article

### Nomenclature
Articles constitute hierarchy based on subject they are dealing with.
So the upper bifurcation are related to subjects that share little in common.
As we go deeper into a subject, we are refining a problem statement and related discussion.
This structuring is subjective, but is easy to understand while navigating.

There are pages that define at each bifurcation, if there is a need to do so.

### Categories of Pages
* article
* idea
* proposal
* ongoing
* exposition
* critique


## Functioning of jekyll



### Theme & Layout
'jekyll-theme-cayman' does not have 'home','post' layouts.
Now it is chosen for minimalist appeal.

### Execution
* '''console bundle exec jekyll serve'''
* site folder is output of jekyll processing
* '''console bundle exec jekyll build --verbose'''
