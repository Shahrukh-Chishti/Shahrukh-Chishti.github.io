Descartes's skepticism traced fundamentals of knowledge backwards to the origin.
This skepticism rejected layers of realism to identify higher levels of abstraction in their direction of idealism.
And thus, he concluded with the fundamental pillar of logical reasoning for everything with __cogito ergo sum__.

It is thus, essential to verify that the extension of this atomic truth explains the spectrum of realism.

what we think is always incomplete ?
