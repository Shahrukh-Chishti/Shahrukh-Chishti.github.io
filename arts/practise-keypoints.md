__control what you consume__

Self-learning music, by practising on musical instrument is a special journey. 
It gives you the feeling of pursuing an independent adventure into a beautiful unkown landscape with very limited constraints. 

Obviously, its the second level of improvement - learning from own mistakes. The first being - learning from others' mistakes. 

Learnine a musical instrument involves:
* technical understanding of the instrument - scales, chords etc.
* physical dexterity of drawing the patterns on the board
* emotional understanding of music - tempo, movements, transition, progression 

Here is a collection of notes/advices, form personal experience, to support this journey:
##  __discipline__
Yeah. Procrastination is a bitch. Keep your instrument uncovered - buy a stand to flaunt it.
Its a physical exercise. muscle memory is real. so is the ability to distinguish intervals.

Many a times picking up after short retirement might give surprisingly good results. This is a trap.
This feel good tempts you to take a longer break, as if you are still strong. 

## __mindufulness__
Do you play and then listen - or - do you imagine and then play. Former is a trap, freshly opened after learning scales.
Makes you think - no - it makes you lose control of the narrative. Yes, it sounds good in the moment, but has no meaning in the larger picture of closure and connections.
It sounds that you should not enjoy your own play. But there are better joys at higher levels of prosody.
And truly, achieving them doesn't take away your moment. 
Its not the sound of the instrument, but the arrangement that captures the beauty.

Imagining music in the mind and then playing out initiates positive reinforcement. This is the learning framework.
Its a process of expressive creativity. Practising music simply means strengthening the bridge between mind(that entails feelings and stories-content) and the instrument. You may allow to enjoy yourself, slowly, until the bridge is built and is robust.
Its absolutely useless to slide on scales, unaimously.

## __breathing__
Solidifies everything. Gives stamina. Improves retentivity. Focus & Control. 
Lowers fatigue. You are fresh after practise session.
