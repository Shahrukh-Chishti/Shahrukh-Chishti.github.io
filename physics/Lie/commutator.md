# Commutators $$[A,B]$$
Commutator appears universally in physical description of dyanmics 
The commutator carries information of the underlying manifold geometry.

### Pushforward

### Parallel transport
The Lie derivative builds on more information than a simple parallel transport.
While the latter requires just a path on a manifold, the former takes in the speed of moving over the path, as well.

## Lie Derivative
Lie algebra builds a vector space, termed as [Fundamental vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_vector_field).

## Physics via Lie Groups
The Heisenberg picture of quantum dynamics makes usage of Lie groups clearer.
All of the dynamics is expressed as evolution of operators.
The generator of temporal evolution is the Hamiltonian operator. So in order to evolve the state of the quantum system, the 
More generally, the operators could be propagated under any other generator.

$$
A(s),U(t) \in G \qquad \dv{A}{s} = a,\dv{U}{t} = O \qquad a,O \in \mathfrak{g} 
$$
